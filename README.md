# Tifinagh Character Recognition Using Deep Learning

In this project, we will be creating a deep learning model for Amazigh handwritten character recognition using artificial intelligence. We will then deploy the model using Fast API and Docker.

## Dataset

The dataset we will be using is the Tifinagh MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 70,000 images of Tifinagh characters, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The images are 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Model

We will be using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for our model. CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks such as this one.

## Training

We will train our model using the Tifinagh MNIST dataset. We will use a 60/40 split, meaning that 60% of the data will be used for training and 40% will be used for validation. We will train for 10 epochs.

## Deployment

We will deploy our model using Fast API and Docker. Fast API is a high-performance web framework for building APIs. Docker is a containerization platform that allows us to deploy our applications in a portable and isolated environment.

## Results

Our model should achieve an accuracy of about 97% on the validation set.
